# Sublime Text Keyboard Shortcuts

`Command + Option + n`

Create a new file.  You can type in the full path where you want the new file, or type `:filename` to create the new file in the directory you're currently in.

`Shift + Command + P`

Delete, rename, copy file - brings up ANF shortcuts rather than the standard `Command + P`.

`Command + P then enter`

Switches to the last file.  Kind of like `Alt + Tab` for just the files in Sublime.

`Command + P`

Goto anything.  Start typing a file name and it will auto-populate closest matches.

`Option + Command + 1-4`

Split view into 1 to 4 panels.

`Command + K, Command + B`

Show / hide sidebar.

Select next instance of selected text.  Keep pressing to select multiple instances.

`Control + Command + G`

Select ALL instances of the highlighted text.

`Command + /`

Comments or uncomments the selected lines.
