### About Me

I am a Bachelor student studying Software Development at Green River College nearly finished with my degree.  My intent for this site is to act as a portfolio to showcase my work, show what I'm learning through my blog, and provide a central location for notes and reference sheets to help with my studies.

I am most passionate and feel most comfortable with Java and doing back-end development in PHP, but I love learning new technologies.  Right now I am spending a lot of time with the MVC framework Laravel both for my Capstone project in school and for my personal site, and I love it!

I am currently looking for an internship or full-time position in software development with an Agile-practicing company that has a great on-boarding and training program.

### Strengths:

- Java (OOP, Eclipse)
- PHP (Laravel)
- Relational Databases (MySQL)
- Bootstrap
- Git

### Tech I want to study more:

- Spring
- C#, .net
- JavaScript & JS Frameworks (Angular / Angular 2, Node.js)

### More!
