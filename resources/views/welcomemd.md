### About Me

I am a Bachelor student studying Software Development at Green River College nearly finished with my degree.  My intent for this site is to act as a portfolio to showcase my work, show what I'm learning through my blog, and provide a central location for notes and reference sheets to help with my studies.

I am most passionate and feel most comfortable with Java and doing back-end development in PHP, but I love learning new technologies.  Right now I am spending a lot of time in Laravel both for my Capstone project in school and for my personal site, and I love it!

### Things on my list to study:

- Spring
- C#, .net
- JavaScript
- Angular / Angular 2
- Node.js

I am currently looking for an internship or full-time position in software development with an Agile-practicing company that has a great on-boarding and training program.
