<h3>Cardiovascular Disease  (CVD)</h3>

Leading cause of death in the World—killing more than 17 million each year

Leading cause of death in the U.S.
#1 killer of both men and women 

Nearly 86 million Americans—1 out of every 3 adults—suffer from one or more types of cardiovascular disease.

Cardiovascular diseases are closely related to lifestyle factors.


<h3>Lifestyle Factors</h3>
Lifestyle factors contributing to CVD include
<ul>
    <li>1.</li>
    <li>2.</li>
    <li>3.</li>
    <li>4.</li>
    <li>5.</li>

<h3>The Cardiovascular System</h3>
A network of organs and     vessels through which blood flows as it carries oxygen and nutrients to all parts of the body.

Heart (size of a fist)
Arteries
Arterioles
Capillaries
Veins and Venules
The heart has four chambers
Sinoatrial node (SA node)


<h3>The Heart</h3>
A healthy heart functions more efficiently and is less likely to suffer damage from overwork.


Average adult heart rate at rest:

The resting heart rate of a well-conditioned heart:
Key Cardiovascular Diseases
Hypertension

atherosclerosis

Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD)

Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)
Heart Attack—myocardial infarction
Angina Pectoris

Arrhythmias

Heart Failure

Stroke
Hypertension
Why is hypertension known as the “Silent Killer”?

African Americans have the highest rates of high blood pressure in the U.S. and globally. 


Systolic pressure:

Diastolic pressure:

Hypertension
How does hypertension affect men vs women?



What would be considered normal “desirable” blood pressure reading?

Atherosclerosis
What is atherosclerosis?


What causes atherosclerosis?

Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD)
Where does peripheral artery disease occur?

What are the symptoms of PAD?

Are these symptoms always present?

Risk factors for PAD include…
Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)
What is a myocardial infarction?

Who is more likely to die after a first heart attack—a man or a woman?

List two common symptoms of a heart attack among men and women:


List three atypical symptoms that are more common among women:



Why should aspirin be taken at the first sign or symptom of a heart attack?

Heart Attack Symptoms Include the Following:
Chest pain or pressure

Arm, neck, or jaw pain

Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
Excessive sweating

Nausea and vomiting

Loss of consciousness

Helping A Heart Attack Victim
The hour following a heart attack is the most crucial.

Metabolic Syndrome

Abdominal obesity:

Elevated blood fat:

Low levels of HDL:





Elevated blood pressure:

Elevated fasting glucose:

Reducing Your Risk for CVD

Avoid Tobacco

Nicotine

Chemicals in smoke

Heart works harder


Cut back on Saturated   fat and Cholesterol

Cholesterol:

Sources of saturated fat:

Trans-fats:

HDL:

LDL:

Triglycerides:



<h3>Reducing Your Risk</h3>

Monitor  your cholesterol   levels:
(See Table 12.2 in your text)



Maintain a Healthy  Weight:




Exercise Regularly:




Control Diabetes:
Control Diabetes
Heart disease death rates among adults with diabetes are 2 to 4 times higher than the rates for adults without diabetes.

At least 65% of people with diabetes die of some form of heart disease or stroke. 

Address Risk Factors
    
Lose weight
Adopt a healthy diet
Control of blood    glucose levels
Increase physical activity and fitness

Reducing Your Risk
Control Your Blood Pressure

Hypertension:


BP Classifications
(See table 12.2 in your text)
Manage Stress

Both acute and chronic stress

Financial stressors

Job and school pressure







 Heart-Healthy  Super Foods
Fish high in omega-3 fatty acids:
Olive oil:
Whole grains and fiber:
Plant sterols and stanols:
Nuts:

Race and Ethnicity 
African Americans are… 



The rate of hypertension in African Americans is among the highest in the world.


Heredity 
CVD has genetic components…
Age
Over the age of 60






Gender 
Men have higher risk earlier in life

Hormonal factors appear to reduce risk for women



Other Risk Factors Being Studied
Inflammation
May play a major role in atherosclerosis development

C-Reactive Protein

Homocysteine
May signal increased risk for CVD

Weapons against CVD
Techniques for Diagnosing Heart Disease:
